# PHP - Laravel

Today I am going to go over how this app works and what it is doing. 
## React Component

Our main page has a tiny React component implemented as an example of React in Laravel.

## File Upload In Laravel

Underneath that we have a file upload button that uses Laravel routing to capture the post data.
The original idea is to capture the event using just php files, but because of laravels MVC style architecture, we have to capture the event through the built in routing configuration in Laravel.
In routing, we create a new route that receives the post request from the form submit.
```php
Route::post('upload', [FileUploadController::class, 'fileUploadPost'])->name('file.upload.post');
```

Next we create a new controller to handle the file upload. We call it FileUploadController.php, and it is located at /app/Http/Controllers/FileUploadController.php
```php
namespace App\Http\Controllers;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;
class FileUploadController extends Controller
{
    /**
     * Display a listing of the resource.
     *
     * @return \Illuminate\Http\RedirectResponse
     */
    public function fileUploadPost(Request $request)
    {
        $name = $request->file->getClientOriginalName();
        $ext = $request->file->extension();
        $originalName = str_replace(".$ext", "", $name);
        $fileuploadRegex = "/[aeiou]/";
        
        $fileNameMatch = preg_match($fileuploadRegex, $originalName);

        if($fileNameMatch) {
            return back()
            ->with('failure',"$originalName did not pass the regex. You Need to have a filename that matches the.")
            ->with('file',$originalName);
        }

        $request->validate([
            'file' => 'required|mimes:pdf,xlx,csv,png|max:4096',
        ]);

        $fileName = time().'.'.$request->file->extension();

        $request->file->move(public_path('uploads'), $fileName);

        return back()
            ->with('success','You have successfully upload file.')
            ->with('file',$fileName);
    }
}
```
When the file upload occurs, and the data is captured by laravel in the backend, the first step is to capture the filename, and run it through the regex:
```php
$name = $request->file->getClientOriginalName();
$ext = $request->file->extension();
$originalName = str_replace(".$ext", "", $name);
$fileuploadRegex = "/[aeiou]/";

$fileNameMatch = preg_match($fileuploadRegex, $originalName);

if($fileNameMatch) {
    return back()
    ->with('failure',"$originalName did not pass the regex. You Need to have a filename that matches the.")
    ->with('file',$originalName);
}
```
If the regex fails, then the response is returned and accepted on the front end using this code:
```php
@if ($message = Session::get('failure'))
    <div class="alert alert-danger alert-block">
        <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="alert">Ã—</button>
        <strong value=>{{ Session::get('failure') }}</strong>
        <strong><a href="#file_constraints">constraints below</a></strong>
        <!-- <strong>{{ Session::get('file') }}</strong> -->
    </div>
@endif
```
If the regex were to pass, we could then add the file contents into a new file with a custom name based on the time, and add it to the uploads folder:
```php
$fileName = time().'.'.$request->file->extension();
$request->file->move(public_path('uploads'), $fileName);
```
We then return to the client a success message:
```php
return back()
    ->with('success','You have successfully upload file.')
    ->with('file',$fileName);
```

## Other Regex Form Inputs

All logic for this app has been though out carfeully and seperated into pieces to allow for an easier read/follow along. In ```welcome.blade.php``` there is a section of code on line 106 that hosts all of our php work for regex forms: 
```php
    <?php include(app_path().'/includes/regex.php'); ?>
```

Inside of regex.php, we use isset and the get request to capture the form submitting for all forms. There is a form on the page that is collective, and individual forms as you scroll down the page. The individual forms contain all of the rules for each form input, and the form at the top is linked to each one individually as an example of the correct input. 

If you enter into the form at the top all of the values and press submit, the form will tell you if all of the values pass their individual regexes, and if they do, say thank you and display the info. If any of the regexes fail, it will display failure and the reason for it.

That is the basis of my Laravel App!

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
